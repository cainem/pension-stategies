        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          This is an educational tool that compares different UK pension withdrawal strategies 
          using historical data. It allows you to explore what would have happened if you had 
          withdrawn your pension at various points in history and invested in different asset classes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>The Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          For some people, the idea of "dropping out" of the traditional financial system is appealing. 
          Whether due to distrust of banks, concerns about currency debasement, or simply a desire for 
          tangible assets, the question arises: <em>what would it actually cost?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The UK pension system offers a unique opportunity to explore this question. Unlike most countries, 
          UK pension rules (since 2015) allow you to withdraw your <strong>entire pension pot at any time</strong> 
          after age 55 (rising to 57 from 2028). This flexibility means you genuinely have the choice to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your money in a SIPP (Self-Invested Personal Pension) invested in stocks</li>
          <li>Withdraw it all, pay the tax, and buy physical gold</li>
          <li>Or any combination of strategies</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>The Gold Option</h2>
        <p>
          Physical gold has a special status in the UK tax system. Specifically, 
          <strong>UK legal tender gold coins</strong> (such as Gold Britannias and Gold Sovereigns) are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>VAT exempt</strong> – no 20% VAT when purchasing</li>
          <li><strong>CGT exempt</strong> – no Capital Gains Tax when selling, regardless of profit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This means if you withdraw your pension (paying income tax on 75% of it), buy gold coins, 
          and they increase in value over time, you pay <em>no additional tax</em> when selling them 
          to fund your retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare this to a SIPP where every withdrawal is taxed as income (75% taxable, 25% tax-free).

        <h2>What This Tool Shows</h2>
        <p>
          This tool uses historical data going back to 1980 to show what would have actually happened 
          under each strategy. It compares:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Physical Gold</strong> – Withdraw pension, pay tax, buy CGT-exempt gold coins</li>
          <li><strong>Gold ETF SIPP</strong> – Keep pension invested in a gold-tracking ETF</li>
          <li><strong>S&amp;P 500 SIPP</strong> – Keep pension invested in US stocks</li>
          <li><strong>Nasdaq 100 SIPP</strong> – Keep pension invested in US tech stocks</li>
          <li><strong>FTSE 100 SIPP</strong> – Keep pension invested in UK stocks</li>
          <li><strong>US Long Treasury SIPP</strong> – Keep pension invested in long-term US bonds (annuity proxy)</li>
          <li><strong>Combined strategies</strong> – 50/50 splits of any two base strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="about-section">
          <h3>Inflation & Purchasing Power</h3>
          <p>
            By default, this tool adjusts annual withdrawals for <strong>UK inflation (CPI)</strong>. 
            This means if you specify a 4% withdrawal rate, the actual pound amount you receive 
            will increase each year to match rising prices, ensuring your lifestyle remains 
            consistent throughout your retirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is critical for long-term simulations (20-30 years), as £10,000 in 1990 would 
            need to be roughly £25,000 in 2024 to buy the same amount of goods and services.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          All calculations include realistic costs: transaction fees, storage fees, management fees, 
          and accurate historical UK tax rates.
