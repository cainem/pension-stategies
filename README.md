## Disclaimer

This tool is for **educational purposes only**. It does not constitute financial advice. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

Key assumptions:
- Pre-2015 comparisons are illustrative only (pension freedom rules didn't exist before April 2015)
- Tax calculations assume pension withdrawal is your only income
- Physical gold assumed to be CGT-exempt UK legal tender coins

Always consult a qualified financial advisor before making pension decisions.
